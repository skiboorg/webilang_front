page_about_title2:`How did it all start?`,
page_about_text5:`In 2006, Konstantin Shestakov, the founder of Webilang, went to the USA to conduct research supported by the Fulbright, US-Russia exchange program.
This was the starting point from which an English and French teacher from Omsk later became a teacher of Russian at a US university. <br><br>
At Iowa State University of Science and Technology Konstantin studied Computer assisted language learning.
When he returned to Russia he was one of the pioneers in comprehensive internet use and web applications for organizing online English courses in Russian universities.`,
page_about_text6:`In 2011 Konstantin joined an international team of educators to teach a distance learning Russian course to American students at Drake University (Iowa). The project was structured as follows:<br><br>
Native speaking teachers +blog for home tasks + interactive computer-based exercises.<br><br>
In 2015 this project became the model for online language school Webilang. We know many online schools have professional non-native english speaking teachers, with excellent English. But besides professionalism, we also value the ability of teachers to immerse students in an authentic social and cultural environment which can only be created by native english speakers.<br><br>
That is why we collaborate with certified native english speaking teachers who have graduated from TESOL programs. Before joining our team, all teachers work as interns learning how to use our schools technology.`,
